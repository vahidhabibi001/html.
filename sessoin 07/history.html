    <p>Hello, I am Vahid Habibi. In this session, I am
         going to review the content of the seventh session. In the seventh
          session, we learned about the basics of CSS, especially the features
           of padding, margining, and border. In that session, we
         learned that the padding feature makes it bigger <br>
         It causes the internal space of the box to enlarge and the content inside
          it to move. The margin feature adjusts the space around
          the box and causes the entire box to move. </p>
