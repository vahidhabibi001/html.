            In today's session, we started the topic of HTML5 <br> and learned about new tags such  [header] and .[nav]. <br>
 Mr. Qudousi complained that the students did not do their homework properly. <br> In this session,
 which was the first HTML5 session, we also discussed the .[audio] and <br> tags, which are used to embed music and video on the site
. Also, we control these tags using properties like controls. for example: <br>
            In this example, we have inserted an audio file using the .audio> tag. <br>
The controls feature displays the playback controls, the loop automatically repeats the music playback <br>
, and the muted mutes the default sound. Also, by using the .source> tag, we can accept different audio file formats <br>
