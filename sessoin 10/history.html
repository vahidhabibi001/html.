    <P>Hello, I am Vahid Habibi. I am very pleased to share my experiences 
        from the previous sessions with you. In our last session, we covered
         important topics such as styling lists and tables. Additionally, 
         we explored various selectors that can be utilized without the need 
         for IDs and classes. This session was very beneficial and informative 
         for me, as we were able to utilize the codes we had previously learned 
         and apply our skills in practice. I hope
         you have also benefited from these sessions and can expand your 
         knowledge</P>
